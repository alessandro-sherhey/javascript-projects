# javascript-projects
In this repository I'll add all the JavaScript projects I'll make with the Codecademy course I'm currently taking. When everything will be ready I will integrate all this projects with a separate page on my [portfolio website](https://github.com/alessandro-sherhey/alessandro-sherhey-website).

### What I used to run and write JavaScript
To run JavaScript I downloaded [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my code editor.

*P.S. This will be the first time I use git commands on the terminal! :)*
